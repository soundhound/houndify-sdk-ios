 HoundTextSearchQuery represents a single text search across its entire life cycle.
 
 Once the application has a search string, the application should
 begin a text search by obtaining a configured instance of HoundTextSearchQuery from
 @code HoundTextSearch -newTextSearchWithSearchText: @endcode
 
 Configure the query as needed, including setting values on the requestInfoBuilder.
 
 HoundTextSearchQuery accepts a delegate, so similar result handling code can be used
 between HoundVoiceSearchQuery and HoundTextSearchQuery, but for HoundTextSearchQuery,
 the delegate is not required.
 
 To perform the search, call -startWithCompletion:
