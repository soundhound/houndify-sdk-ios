/**
 The five phases in the life cycle of a HoundVoiceSearchQuery instance.

 - HoundVoiceSearchQueryStateNotStarted: Initial state
 - HoundVoiceSearchQueryStateRecording: HoundifySDK is listening for speech and streaming
   audio to the Houndify server for transcription. Calling -start causes the query to enter
   this state.
 - HoundVoiceSearchQueryStateSearching: HoundifySDK is no longer streaming audio for this
   search, and the Houndify server is preparing a response.
 - HoundVoiceSearchQueryStateSpeaking: Calling -speakResponse after a response has been
   received moves the query into this state.
 - HoundVoiceSearchQueryStateFinished: This query is complete, and another query can begin.
